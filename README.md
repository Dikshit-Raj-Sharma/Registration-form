# HTML Forms Project

This is a simple web project focused on building and styling HTML forms.

The goal is to practice how to:
- Create structured and accessible HTML forms
- Use different input types (text, email, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.)
- Group form elements with proper labels and fieldsets
- Handle form submission (basic setup)
- Apply basic styling to form elements using CSS

More features and functionality may be added as the project progresses.
